Worked on a **Data Visualisation** platform, which main focus was to monitor company servers. The idea was to get all the consumption data of servers and **CI pipelines** and correlate them with time, day. This helped identify what was normal under certain hours and what was not, and identify anomalies and see if it's correlated to a pipeline or not. 
I used **D3.js** and **Highcharts.js** to draw the graphics. I got inpired by a ***New York Times*** article that displayed in a Bubbly way the american budget. Highcharts was mainly used for timeline purposes, it was pretty easy to use it for that so i didn't bother trying to get D3.js to do that. It could've been interesting but there wasn't much time and the learning curve of D3 is quite steep.
